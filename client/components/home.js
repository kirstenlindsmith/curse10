        Hi! My name is Kirsten (pronounced "curse ten"), and I'm a frontend
        software developer.
      </p>

      <p>
        Once upon a time, I was a special education teacher and graphic designer who
        fell in love with programming. I have a natural love of detail, a deep
        appreciation for beautiful things, and an obsessive need to organize the
        world around me, so learning to code was like meeting a soulmate.
      </p>

      <p>
        I have a full stack background, including but not limited to: Node,
        Typescript, Express, PostgreSQL, React, HTML & CSS.
      </p>

      <p>
        Being both an artist and developer allows me to make sure no detail is
        lost in translation. My true love is frontend web development, so when I
        draw a mockup of an app, Iâ€™m already planning how to build it.
      </p>

      <p>
        In my non-coding time I play video games, make art, write and speak
        about autism, and read all types of fantasy.
      </p>
