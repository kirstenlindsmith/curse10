        I'm Kirsten (pronounced "curse ten"), a full stack software engineer and
        developer.
      </p>

      <p>
        I'm a graphic designer who fell in love with code. I have a natural love
        of meticulous detail and systemizing, and a deep appreciation for
        creating maintainable code with beautiful, intuitive UX.
      </p>

      <p>
        I originally started out in the medical field, graduating with a
        combined degree in Biology, Microbiology, and Anthropology from the
        University of Massachusetts Amherst. I worked in the autism world for
        many years, as an early-intervention therapist, classroom teacher,
        curriculum designer, and consultant. I decided to pursue my love of art
        and design, and made a shift to graphic design, turning my consulting
        into a side business.
      </p>

      <p>
        I decided to try my hand at writing code, and the rest was history. I
        was obsessed; I had finally found something that combined all my skills
        and interests in one. I quit my job, and dove head-first into teaching
        myself Javascript. I was accepted to the Grace Hopper Program at
        Fullstack Academy of Code and there gained proficiency in full-stack app
        development, including Node.js, React, Express, SQL/ORM databases,
        advanced HTML & CSS, and computer science fundamentals.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now, as a programmer, being both a graphic designer and developer allows
        me to make sure no detail is lost in translation. When I draw up a
        mockup of an app, Iâ€™m already planning how to build it.
      </p>

      <p>
        In my spare time I enjoy both making and playing video games, drawing,
        writing about autism, and reading all types of fantasy.
