        I'm Kirsten (pronounced "curse ten"), a full stack software engineer and
        developer.
      </p>

      <p>
        I'm a graphic designer who fell in love with code. I have a natural love
        of detail and systemizing, and a deep appreciation for creating
        maintainable code with beautiful UX.
      </p>

      <p>
        I originally started out in the medical field, graduating with a
        combined degree in Biology, Microbiology, and Anthropology from the
        University of Massachusetts Amherst. I worked in the autism world for
        many years, as an early-intervention therapist, classroom teacher,
        curriculum designer, and consultant. Wanting to pursue my love of art, I
        made a shift to graphic design, turning my consulting into a side
        business.
      </p>

      <p>
        I decided to try my hand at writing code, and the rest was history. It
        was love at first function, and I was obsessed; I felt I had finally
        found something that combined all my skills and interests in one. I quit
        my job, and dove head-first into teaching myself Javascript. I was
        accepted to the Grace Hopper Program at Fullstack Academy of Code and
        there gained proficiency in full-stack app development, working with
        Node.js, React, Express, SQL/ORM databases, advanced HTML & CSS, and
        computer science fundamentals.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now, as a programmer, being both a graphic designer and developer allows
        me to make sure no detail is lost in translation. When I draw a mockup
        of an app, Iâ€™m already planning how to build it.
      </p>

      <p>
        In my spare time I enjoy both making and playing video games, making
        art, writing about autism, and reading all types of fantasy.
