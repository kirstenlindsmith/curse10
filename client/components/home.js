        I'm Kirsten (pronounced "curse ten"), a full stack software engineer and
        developer.
      </p>

      <p>
        I'm a graphic designer who fell in love with code. I have a natural love
        of detail and systemizing, with an appreciation for creating
        maintainable code, and beautiful UX.
      </p>

      <p>
        I specialize in full-stack app development, including but not limited
        to: Node.js, React, Redux, Express, PostgreSQL, HTML & CSS.
      </p>

      <p>
        Being both a graphic designer and developer allows me to make sure no
        detail is lost in translation. When I draw a mockup of an app, Iâ€™m
        already planning how to build it.
      </p>

      <p>
        In my spare time I enjoy both making and playing video games, making
        art, writing about autism, and reading all types of fantasy.
